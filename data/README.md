# Put any data files in this folder

Ideally your data is a CSV file.

In this folder, the netflix_raw_data is the original dataset for first visualization, which is downloaded from the Kaggle website. The link to this web page of this Netflix dataset is contained in the README.md root file. 

I manually modify the dataset and eliminate the dataset into the 11 countries, which include the United States and the top ten countries that have the largest number of movies in their local Netflix library. In nutflixNumberOfShowsAndMovies.csv, this dataset includes all 11 elements and their number of shows and number of movies respectfully. This csv file was used as the data scource of the grouped bar chart.


The raw dataset for second visualization is data/Netflix Shows.csv, and then I generated data/netflixTV14ratings.csv file. This modified dataset is for the second visualization. The line chart on web page is based on this dataset to show myaudiences that  increasing number of Netflix TV shows over years on Channel TV14.

If you do so, it is a pain to remove it later and it may have already been crawled by other sources. But [here is how you do so](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository).
