    <h1>Assignment: Basic charts in D3</h1>
    <h2>Yuxi Shen</h2>

    <h3> Abstract </h3>
    <p>
      There will be two visualizations on this web page, and both of them showing the data 
      from Netflix company. The datasets for these two data visualizations are acquired from 
      Kaggle website, and the links are provided in the ending area. 
      <br> 
      <br>
      In the grouped bar chart visualization, I want to show my audiences the difference between the either the 
      number of movies or the number of TV shows between the United States and the countries 
      which has the top 10 largest Netflix film libraries. It is clear to see that the top 10 countries have more than 4500 
      movies in their national Netflix libraries. In constrast, US has around 4000 movies in its library. This grouped bar chart 
      also shows that all 11 countries have a similar number of TV shows in their libraries. Therefore, if Netflix wants to attract 
      more US customers, it should include more movies in the US-region movie library. 
      <br>
      <br>
      In the line chart, I want to display that from 2003 to 2017 on TV14 channel, there are more and more TV shows were produced by netflix. 
      From the original dataset, I found that there are increasing TV shows being published over years on each TV channel. So, 
      I want to focus on TV14 channel to examine the amount of TV shows it produces between 2004 and 2007. 
      The original dataset of this visualization is also found on Kaggle, and the link is provided below. 
    </p>

    <h3>Simple formatting instructions</h3>

    <p>
      Use <code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code> tags to enclose a paragraph in html. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;</code> to enclose a heading. <br>
      Use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to force a line break.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two pre-made <code>div</code> in this document that will hold your visualizations. The first one has id
      <code>vis1</code>, the second one has <code>vis2</code>. Write your explanation and analysis close to each of your
      visualization.
      <br>
      <br>
    </p>

    <h3>Visualizations</h3>
    <p> <b>Descriptive prose: </b>
      <em>links are provided in the Acknowledgments area.</em>
      <br>
      <b>1. Explain the dataset you choose to use and why you chose it:</b>>
      <br>
      In this assignment, the database I choose comes from the data website Kaggle. 
      The two databases I chose are both from Netflix. The reason for choosing the database of
       this company is that, first of all, I am crazy about the TV series produced by Netflix. In addition, 
      I hope to have a better understanding of the growing trend of the company's TV series production over 
      the years through the visualization I made.
      <br>
      <b> 2. State for each visualization what types of data you used</b>
      <br>
      <u>1st Visualization: </u>
      <br>Categorical data used for this visualization, categorized by countries. 
      <br>Marks: lines and area
      <br>Channel: size and area
      <br>
      <u>2nd Visualization:</u>
      <br>Ordinal data used for this visualization, following year timeline. 
      <br>Marks: lines
      <br>Channel: position 
      <br>
      <b>3. Justify why your encoding (i.e. bar or line) is appropriate for the type for the data you are visualizing in them</b>
      <br>
      1. I use this grouped bar chart since I want to know the quantity of movies/ TV shows(the vertical spatial position channel for the quantitative attribute)
       were provided to each country(the horizontal spatial position channel for the categorical attribute). 
       I can see the values of items with the length of each bar clearly. 
      I can show the grouped comparison between different countries of numbers of movies and TV shows. Only an grouped bar chart can do this. 
      <br>
      2. Line chart helps me track changes of numbers of TV shows(the vertical spatial position channel for the quantitative attribute) 
      over time (the horizontal spatial position channel for the ordered attribute).
       When smaller changes exist, the line chart is better than the bar plot.
       At the same time, the line chart has only one line on it, so it looks cleaner than the bar chart. 

    </p>
    <h4>The first visualization aims to shows the audiences:</h4>

    <p>
        1. The comparison of number of TV shows and movies in each country. 
      <br>  
        2. The comparison of number of TV shows and movies between each country. 
      <br>  
        3. The comparison of number of TV shows and movies between the other ten countries and the United States.
      <br> 
      <br>
        The x scale is the names of countries, and the y scale represents the quantity of movies/TV shows. 
        Please slip your mouse over the bars to highlight the bars which you want them to stand out.

    <h4>
      The second visualization goes here:
    </h4>

    <p>
      1. This line chart tries to show that the number of Netflix shows on Channel 14 is increasing, especially from 2011 
      and 2017. The reason behind the steep rise of TV might be the streaming service that Netflix started offering globally. 
      By 2016 its streaming service was available in more than 190 countries and territories. 
      <br>
      <br>
      2. As the number of shows is increasing, there are more and more users subscribe to Netflix to watch TV shows. 
      Because the number of TV programs has increased, so has the diversity of TV programs. 
      Then the number of subscribers to the channel or Netflix service will also increase, 
      which is also a positive stimulus to the growth of the number of TV programs. 
      The source of this positive stimulation is also Netflix's consistently high level of quality. 
      For example, my personal favorites Grey's Anatomy and Sherlock were released in 2016.
